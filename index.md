## About This Research

This documentation covers patterns, principles, and practices for building effective multi-agent systems. The content is based on practical experience designing and operating agentic pipelines.

## Documentation Overview

| Document | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| [Design Principles](/docs/design-principles/) | Core principles for multi-agent design |
| [Failure Modes](/docs/failure-modes/) | Taxonomy of failures with detection/prevention |
| [Architecture Patterns](/docs/architecture-patterns/) | Pipeline, orchestration, and state patterns |
| [Handoff Design](/docs/handoff-design/) | Inter-agent communication contracts |
| [Human Oversight](/docs/human-oversight/) | Checkpoints, synthesis, and escalation |
| [Domain Applications](/docs/domain-applications/) | Applying patterns to new domains |

## Reading Paths

### For New Agent Designers

1. Start with **Design Principles** for foundational concepts
2. Review **Failure Modes** to understand what can go wrong
3. Study **Architecture Patterns** to choose the right structure
4. Learn **Handoff Design** for agent communication
5. Understand **Human Oversight** for checkpoint placement

### For Debugging

1. Use **Failure Modes** diagnosis protocol
2. Identify the failure type
3. Apply the relevant prevention/recovery strategy

### For Domain Adaptation

1. Review **Domain Applications** framework
2. Study the example domains (Policy, Intelligence)
3. Follow the adaptation steps for your domain
